At Dec 3, Marvel Entertainment published a second trailer for "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"
In few days, "JoBlo Movie Trailers" channel made a video, with Easter Egg Countdown, that he was found at official trailer.

I've tried to count, how many video frames was used from trailer.
This video have 135 seconds duration and contain more than 43 frames! I'm pretty sure, that I miss something.
This is huge amount of work and time - create such type of video. Each frame must be finded, cut, then you need to add it to your video, add effects, add your voice track, text, etc.
If you like this video, please subscribe to this channel ad click on bell too - and you will receive all next videos.

I think this service can help to youtube video makers.
If you have a script for your future video, you can prepare video frames, that you want to use.
This service was build to help save youtubers time for creating their awesome videos!
You can create a list with start and end points of video that you want to use, then add link to youtube video - and you'll got video frame, important only for you.

This service can be used for:
Fail Compilations 
"Top 5 of anything"
Epic kills in shooter games
Funny moments from live streams
baseball, basketball matches, soccer goals,
News video
tech video
periscope video(available on youtube)
vines compilation(available on youtube)




Case 2: Poker streamer playing in tournament. Whole video have 4 hours of game. Sometimes poker can be boring to watch, so it's cool idea to create set of frames with interesting showdowns, bluffs, coinflips, other gambling things.
